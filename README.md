# Advent of Code 2016

Going back and completing the old
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges. My goal for this one is
to work on producing tidy Prolog solutions using any of the predicates from the
standard SWI-Prolog library.

## Instructions

All solvers take a command line argument indicating which part to solve, and
read their input from stdin. For example, to run part 2 of the Day 1 solver with
the input in `input.txt`, type:
```
./01.pl 2 < input.txt
```
